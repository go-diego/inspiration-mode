        "description": "A certain Wolf could not get enough to eat because of the watchfulness of the Shepherds. But one night he found a sheep skin that had been cast aside and forgotten. The next day, dressed in the skin, the Wolf strolled into the pasture with the Sheep. Soon a little Lamb was following him about and was quickly led away to slaughter.",

Then after sundown, when the rosy light fades from the sky and the shadows rise slowly through the wood, out she comes ruffling and blinking from the old hollow tree. Now her weird \"hoo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo\" echoes through the quiet wood, and she begins her hunt for the bugs and beetles, frogs and mice she likes so well to eat.",

But the Eagle pounced upon her prey, the sweep of her great wings tumbling the Beetle a dozen feet away.

The Eagle's grief and anger knew no bounds, but who had done the cruel deed she did not know.",
